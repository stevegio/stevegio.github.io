Jim Carrey [asking](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/comedian-jim-carrey-delete-your-facebook-account-and-dump-the-stock.html?__source=facebook%7Ctech) investors to dump their Facebook stock and for people to delete their accounts. Doesn't seem to be swaying many because the price is pretty close to its 52 week high.
