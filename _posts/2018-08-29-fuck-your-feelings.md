[Fuck Your Feelings](https://overcast.fm/+B06_Hdzdk) is a remarkable episode of the Love & Radio Podcast. I found it to be profoundly disturbing yet enlightening. I struggle mightily to understand Trump supporters. This at least gives me an insight into the psychology of some. The desire to simplify daily existence seems like a key motivator. It’s a desire driven not by fear but fatigue in dealing with the world as it is. Of course that’s great if your cis, white, and well off. If not the reality of the world has a way of hitting you in the face with a 2x4 on a constant basis. Winding the cultural clock back to the 1950s is a shitty idea.
