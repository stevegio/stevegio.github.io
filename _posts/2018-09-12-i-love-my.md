I love my current iPhone X. It’s perfect. Even the notch. Will Apple release something today to tempt me to open up my wallet? I’m not sure. I won’t know for sure until later in the day. I’m on site with a customer all day so won’t be able to watch the event live. Hoping there are new software features that my X and Series 3 Apple Watch can leverage without new hardware but I’m not that confident in that outcome. 🍎📱⌚️
