Paddled about 40 minutes to a small secluded cove off the inlet at Barnegat Light. Such a beautiful spot. My only company were a few sea gulls and cormorants feeding off the small fish in the water. Collected some odd bits of plastic to leave the place cleaner than it was before I got there. I like to think this kind of cleanup makes a difference. After all, I didnâ€™t use to do this but was inspired by an older couple who regularly picked up plastic while they walked up and down the beach.
